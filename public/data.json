  "answer": "useState is a hook in React that allows functional components to have state.When you call useState, it returns an array with two values: the current state value, and a function to update the state.You can use the state value in your component's render method, and call the update function to change the state and trigger a re-render."

  "question": "How does React worked?",
  "answer": "React works by using a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render changes to the UI without having to manipulate the actual browser DOM.React also utilizes a unidirectional data flow, meaning that changes in the application state trigger updates to the UI, rather than the other way around, which helps to keep the code organized and easier to reason about."
